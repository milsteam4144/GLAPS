Things to search for capstone:

hope to use:
value before building of stadium
value after building of stadium
natural disasters in area
flood planes
crime rates 
tax rates 
school ratings

found:
median household income
median house values

need to decide:

how many houses and what specific location from the stadium are they located.
The pages that we should require.
The look.
How to split up the tasks?
All do the research and data.
size of properties
use average price of houses in that school district or area
leave some cities out of learning data to see if predictions are working. 

Questions:

how to format data to input to machine?

how to use census website api?

how are we going to use mysql bc of firewall at school?

oracel database?

can we just give it the mean value per year before and after?

how do we tell it the year the stadium was built in each zip code?

will this automatically take inflation into account for these areas or will the machine only provide an increase due 
directly to the stadium? for example, will it be like this machine calculated that on top of current housing trends 
this house will be worth 5% more or 5% less dues to the stadium. Do we need to teach it general market trends?

notes:
program we need a variable that will hold the stadium opening dates to setup as split point
csv file with the dates for each city stadium opening day
6 months before opening and 6 months after
variable for how many months before and after opening to receive data for
weed out years where it was rented

find out easier way to obtain county numbers for the cities we need for 1 year acs

**need to find way to get state and county numbers quickly (place in database?)

Format= 
https://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1/subject?get=S1501_C01_001E,NAME&for=county:051&in=state:37
S1501_C01_018E = % of people with ed level of high school or higher
S1902_C01_001E = mean income
S1903_C01_001E = median income
S1701_C01_034E = number of people in poverty status
S0101_C01_030E = median age

Format = https://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1/profile?get=DP03_0001E,DP03_0002E,DP04_0089E,NAME&for=county:051&in=state:37
DP03_0002E = number of people in labor force
DP03_0062E = median household income
DP03_0086E = median family income
DP03_0090E = median non family income
DP03_0092E = Median earnings for workers


Format = https://api.census.gov/data/2011/acs/acs1?get=NAME,B01001_001E&for=county:*&in=state:* (doesn’t have word profile)
B01003_001E = total population
B25103_001E = median real estate tax
B25105_001E = median monthly household costs
C25075_001E = total number of houses in area
B25077_001E =  median home values

If table starts with D (word profile after acs1/) 
If table starts with S (word subject after acs1/)
If table starts with B (no word after acs1/)

Couldn’t find crime rates or school ratings in census but I think this is enough to start with

add pytests for when it selects the random locations

ToDo:
find one year versions of census tables for median household values and household incomes for zipcodes
watch video mallory sent me
try to work on login
look up stadiums between 2012-2014 get zip codes
census data online goes from 2009-2017
